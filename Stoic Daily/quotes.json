They will never be able to keep you from doing what's sound, so don't let them knock out your good will for them. Keep a steady watch on both fronts, not only for the well-based judgements and actions, but also for gentleness with those who would obstruct our path or create other difficulties. For getting angry is also a weakness, just as much as abandoning the task for surrendering under panic. For doing either is an equal desertion-the one by shrinking back and the other by estrangement from family and friend.",
